# Stacks: by GPT


## Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, that is, the last element inserted is the first to be removed. It's like a stack of dishes: you always add and remove from the top.


### Main Features:

    Insertion: Elements are added to the top of the stack (push).
    Removal: Elements are removed from the top (pop).
    Order: Keeps the elements so that the last one in is the first one out.

### Main operations:

    Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
    Pop: Remove the top element.
    Peek/Top: Observe the element at the top without removing it.
    IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
