# Data Structure: by GPT


## Data Structures are organized ways to store, manage, and access data so that it can be used efficiently. They are fundamental in computer science, as they determine how data is organized in memory and how operations (such as search, insertion, deletion, etc.) are performed.


## Main types of data structures:

### Linear: Elements organized in sequence.
        
        Array: Collection of elements of the same type, accessed by index.
        Linked Lists: Elements connected by pointers.
        Queues: Follow the FIFO (First In, First Out) rule.
        Stacks: Follow the LIFO (Last In, First Out) rule.

###  Non-Linear: Elements organized in a hierarchical or connected way.
        
        Trees: Data in the form of a hierarchy; E.g.: Binary tree.
        Graphs: Represent connections or relationships between elements.

### Hashing: Uses hash functions to map data to indexes. 

    Ex.: Hash Tables (Python Dictionaries).


## Why are they important?

    They allow you to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
    They solve specific problems with less use of resources.
    Fundamentals for implementing algorithms.


### Repository dedicated to helping those who are starting out in programming, or need to review and reinforce their knowledge with data structures.

### Most of the examples presented were based on the books: Self-Taught Computer Scientist, by Cory Althoff, and Python and Django, by Francisco Marcelo.
