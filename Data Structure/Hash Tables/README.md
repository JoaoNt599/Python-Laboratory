# Hash Tables: by GPT


## Hash Tables are data structures that store key-value pairs and allow quick access to data by using a hash function to calculate an index into the table where the values ​​are stored.

## How they work:

    Key: Unique identifier for each value.
    Hash Function: Transforms the key into an index within an array.
    Storage: The value is stored in the position calculated by the index.


## Features:

    Fast search: Access in O(1) time in the best case.
    Collision handling: When two keys generate the same index, they use methods such as chaining or linear probing.
