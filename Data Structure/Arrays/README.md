# Arrays: by GPT


## Arrays are data structures that store elements of the same type in contiguous positions in memory. Each element can be accessed directly through an index, which makes them efficient for searching and accessing.


### Main Features:

    Direct access: O(1) time to access any element by index.
    Fixed size: The size is defined at creation time (in low-level languages ​​like C).
    Homogeneity: All elements have the same type.

### Common operations:

    Access: Use the index to access elements.
    Insertion: In O(n) time if it is necessary to move elements.
    Removal: Requires shifting elements, making it O(n) in the worst case.
    Search: It can be linear (O(n)) or binary (O(log n)) depending on the organization of the data.
