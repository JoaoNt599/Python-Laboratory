# String


## String Search Algorithm:
    
    Finding the occurrence of a pattern in a string.
    Examples include algorithms like Naive Search, Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm, and Boyer-Moore Algorithm.

## Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Algorithm:
    
    Finding the longest common subsequence between two sequences.
    Can be used to compare similarities between two strings.

## Edit Distance Algorithm:
 
    Measuring the difference between two strings, represented by the minimum number of edit operations (insertion, removal, substitution) needed to convert one string into another.
    The Wagner-Fisher algorithm is an example.

## Rabin-Karp Algorithm:

    Used to find patterns in text.
    Utilizes hash functions to quickly check if a pattern occurs at a particular position in the string.

## Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm:

    An efficient pattern-searching algorithm.
    Uses precomputed information about the pattern to avoid unnecessary comparisons.

## Boyer-Moore Algorithm:

    Another efficient pattern-searching algorithm.
    Explores information about the last occurrence of each character in the pattern to skip sections of the input string during the search.

## Data Compression Algorithm (e.g., Lempel-Ziv-Welch):

    Reducing the size of a string by representing repetitions of substrings with shorter codes.
    Used in data compression.

## Manacher's Algorithm:

    Finding the longest palindromic substring in a string.
    Efficient for finding all palindromes in a string.
    

## These algorithms play crucial roles in various applications, from pattern searching to data compression and natural language processing. The choice of the algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.
