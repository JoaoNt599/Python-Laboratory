# Queue: by GPT


## Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, that is, the first element inserted is the first to be removed. It's like a queue in the real world: first in is first out.


### Main Features:

    Insertion: Elements are added at the end (called rear).
    Removal: Elements are removed from the beginning (called front).
    Order: Keeps elements in the order of arrival.

### Main operations:

    Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
    Dequeue: Remove the element from the beginning of the queue.
    Peek: Observe the element in front without removing it.
    IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
